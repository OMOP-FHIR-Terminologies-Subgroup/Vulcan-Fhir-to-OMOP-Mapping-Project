The synthea-micro-01 and synthea-microw-02 zip files available here are the two parts of a FHIR (R4) representation of 2,500 patients.  
The file was generated using the fhir-to-omop tools for downloading data from a fhir server (https://nachc-cad.github.io/fhir-to-omop/index.html). 
These files were downloaded from the mitre synthmass FHIR server (https://syntheticmass.mitre.org/v1/fhir)
This tool basically gets a list of patient ids from a FHIR server and then downloads each patient using the /Patient/@patientId/$everything resource.  
Downloads using the method are paged, therefore a patient is often represeted by multiple downloads.  
Therefore, the syntha-micro.zip file contains a file for each patient.  
Each folder contains the files that represents the full history of that patient.  

Other test data sets are available directly from mitre at:

The syntha-micro data set with a full set of OHDISI terminology files is available at:
